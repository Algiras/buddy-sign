== Version 0.4.0

Date: 2015-02-22

- Add encode/decode functions to JWS/JWT implementation. Them instead of return
  plain value, return a monadic either. That allows granular error reporting
  instead something like nil that not very useful. The previous sign/unsign
  are conserved for backward compatibility but maybe in future will be removed.
- Rename parameter `maxage` to `max-age` on jws implementation. This change
  introduces a little backward incompatibility.
- Add "compact" signing implementation as replacemen of django based one.
- Django based generic signing is removed.
- Update buddy-core version to 0.4.0


== Version 0.3.0

Date: 2014-01-18

- First version splitted from monolitic buddy package.
- No changes from original version.
