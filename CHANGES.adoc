== Version 0.4.0

Date: unreleased

- Add encode/decode functions to JWS/JWT implementation. Them instead of return
  plain value, return a monadic either. That allows granular error reporting
  instead something like nil that not very useful. The previous sign/unsign
  are conserved for backward compatibility but maybe in future will be removed.
- Rename parameter `maxage` to `max-age` on jws implementation. This change
  introduces a little backward incompatibility.
- Add "compact" signing implementation as replacemen of django based one.
- Django based generic signing is removed.
